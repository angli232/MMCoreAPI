# MMCoreAPI

MMCoreAPI provides a portable C DLL interface to MMCore C++ API of Micro-Manager 2.0.

To use the C interface, include header `MMCoreC/MMCoreC.h`, and link against `MMCoreC.dll`. A prebuilt DLL is provided at `lib/MMCoreC.dll`, which is built with `vc142` toolset.

This C DLL not only works with MSVC, but also works with MinGW. This project was initially started because Micro-Manager 1.4 uses VC 2010 compiler, and a C++ DLL generated by VC 2010 is not binary-compatible with VC 2015-2022. Micro-Manager 2.0 has migrated to VC 2019, so it is possible to build and use a C++ DLL of `MMCore` instead.

A Go interface (based on Cgo) is provided. However, it is no longer actively used by the author.

## Build
### Dependencies
* MSVC 2019 or 2022
* [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io) installed to `C:\vcpkg` (to get `boost-1.77.0`)
* (Optional) [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) (for faster build, although it cannot select vc142 toolchain in MSVC 2022)

### Additional notes

#### Select vc142 toolset installed with VS 2022 in VS Code
It be should fine to use vc143. However, because Micro-Manager 2.0 officially uses vc142, it may be needed to use vc142 under certain conditions.

You can install vc142 with VS 2022.

To set up the kit in VS Code. Launch `CMake: Edit User-Local CMake Kits` in `Command Palette`. Make a copy of the VS 2022 `amd64` kit and add `vc142` in toolset parameter. This will pass `-T v142,host=x64` to `cmake.exe`

When configurating and building the project with CMake, you need to use `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator, because `Ninja` generator does not support this way of toolset selection.

Example:
```json
{
    "name": "Visual Studio Community 2022 Release - amd64 (v142)",
    "visualStudio": "afb0c136",
    "visualStudioArchitecture": "x64",
    "preferredGenerator": {
      "name": "Visual Studio 17 2022",
      "platform": "x64",
      "toolset": "v142,host=x64"
    }
  }
```
